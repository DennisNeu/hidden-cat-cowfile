## 🎯 Why Hidden Cat?

Most cat cowfiles are:

- Too big
- Too busy
- Too distracting

`hidden-cat` is different:

- ✅ **Compact** — takes up minimal vertical space
- ✅ **Clean** — simple lines, no bloat
- ✅ **Cute** — still full of personality
- ✅ **Terminal-friendly** — great for minimalist setups or small screens

Perfect for devs, sysadmins, or anyone who wants just a *hint* of whiskered wisdom in their terminal.
